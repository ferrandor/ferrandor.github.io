    <h1>Robert Ferrando</h1>
    <p>I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Information Systems
      and Modeling Group at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos
        National Laboratory</a>. I received my PhD in Applied
      Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University

        of Arizona</a> in August, 2025, under the advisement of Misha
      Chertkov. My doctoral thesis was on <i>Physics-Informed
        Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Scale Energy Systems</i>. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I have broad interests in interdisciplinary applied and
      computational mathematics applied to energy systems. Some of my
      recent projects involve:<br>
    </p>
    <p>(1.) Physics-informed machine learning for real-time electricity
      market clearing. <br>
      (2.) Mixed-integer nonlinear programming for operation of power
      transmission and distribution grids.<br>
      (3.) Data-driven stochastic control of interconnected power and
      natural gas grids.<br>
      (4.) Bayesian surrogate modeling for stochastic natural gas
      dynamics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My mathematical training is primarily in optimization, numerical
      methods, and applied probability and statistics. Computer
      programming is a critical part of my day-to-day work. I mostly use
      the Julia programming language. I consider myself an
      application-driven programmer, and I am always striving to improve
      my coding workflow.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Earlier Biographical Information<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Prior to beginning graduate school, I received a BS in
      Mathematics from the Macaulay Honors College at CUNY, College of
      Staten Island (CSI). While at CSI, I worked with Stephen Wollman
      on kinetic equations of plasma physics. Following graduation, I
      was also an adjunct lecturer at CSI, where I taught introductory
      undergraduate courses in algebra, precalculus, and statistics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even prior to my undergraduate studies, I attended Staten Island
      Technical High School, where I was properly introduced to both the
      mathematical and social sciences. <br>
    </p>
    <p>When I am not working, my hobbies include listening to classic
      rock music, reading about current events, writing, and Linux
      computing. I also enjoy the outdoors and frequently utilize local
      hiking trails. My pronouns are <i>he/him</i>. Please refer to me
      as "Robert" in all correspondence.</p>
    <h2>How to engage with me:<br>
    </h2>
    <p><b>How to contact me:</b> The best way to reach me is by email to
      r.ferrando@protonmail.com. I do not check my personal email
      account on a daily basis. You can generally expect at most a
      one-week turnaround. I am also on LinkedIn, but I am not active.
      If you need to reach me for work, you likely know how without
      needing to refer to this website.<i> As a general rule, I do not
        answer external inquiries about my work.<br>
      </i></p>
    <p><b>Publications:</b> You can find my publications on my <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8IlEM74AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google

        Scholar</a> profile.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Code:</b> When possible, I plan to make code publicly
      available on GitHub. This is often not possible depending on the
      nature of the project. My GitHub handle is <a
        href="https://github.com/ferrandor">ferrandor</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Letters of recommendation:</b> I do not write letters of
      recommendation unless I have mentored a student for a substantial
      length of time, typically at least 2-3 months. If you ask for a
      letter of recommendation, you should provide a CV, transcript, any
      relevant statements that may be part of your application, and an
      itemized list of deadlines with instructions for how to submit my
      letter, plus dates <i>and times</i> (use 5:00 pm Eastern time if
      not sure). In addition, I will not provide permission for you to
      see my letter<i> except under the most extraordinary circumstances</i>.
      I believe this request on the part of an employer is wildly
      unethical, and I cannot provide an unbiased assessment with the
      knowledge that you will read it.<br>
