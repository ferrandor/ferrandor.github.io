    <h1>Robert Ferrando</h1>
    <p>I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Information Systems
      and Modeling Group at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos
        National Laboratory</a>. I received my PhD in Applied
      Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University




        of Arizona</a> in August, 2025, under the advisement of <a
        href="https://sites.arizona.edu/misha-chertkov/">Misha Chertkov</a>.
      My doctoral thesis was on <i>Physics-Informed Artificial
        Intelligence for Multi-Scale Energy Systems</i>. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>I have broad interests in interdisciplinary applied and
      computational mathematics applied to energy systems. Some of my
      recent projects involve:<br>
    </p>
    <p>(1.) Physics-informed machine learning for real-time electricity
      market clearing. <br>
      (2.) Mixed-integer nonlinear programming for operation of power
      transmission and distribution grids.<br>
      (3.) Data-driven stochastic control of interconnected power and
      natural gas grids.<br>
      (4.) Bayesian surrogate modeling for stochastic natural gas
      dynamics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My mathematical training is primarily in optimization, numerical
      methods, and applied probability and statistics. Computer
      programming is a critical part of my day-to-day work. I mostly use
      the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming
      language. I consider myself an application-driven programmer, and
      I am always striving to improve my coding workflow.<br>

    <h2>Earlier Biographical Information<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Prior to beginning graduate school, I received a BS in
      Mathematics from the <a href="https://macaulay.cuny.edu/">Macaulay


        Honors College</a> at <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/">CUNY</a>,
      <a href="https://www.csi.cuny.edu/">College of Staten Island</a>
      (CSI). While at CSI, I worked with <a
        href="https://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/People/faculty/Wollman-Stephen.html">Stephen


        Wollman</a> on kinetic equations of plasma physics. Following
      graduation, I was also an adjunct lecturer at CSI, where I taught
      introductory undergraduate courses in algebra, precalculus, and
      statistics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even prior to my undergraduate studies, I attended Staten Island
      Technical High School, where I was properly introduced to both the
      physical and social sciences. <br>
    </p>
    <p>When I am not working, my hobbies include listening to classic
      rock music, reading about current events, writing, and Linux
      computing. I also enjoy the outdoors and frequently utilize local
      hiking trails. My pronouns are <i>he/him</i>. I prefer to be
      addressed as "Robert" in professional correspondence.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>How to engage with me:<br>
    </h2>
    <p><b>How to contact me:</b> The best way to reach me is by email to
      r.ferrando@protonmail.com. I do not check my personal email
      account on a daily basis. You can generally expect at most a
      one-week turnaround. I am also on LinkedIn, but I am not active.
      If you need to reach me for work, you likely know how without
      needing to refer to this website.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Publications:</b> You can find my journal and conference
      publications, dissertations, and theses <a
        href="uploads/publications.html">here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Code:</b> When possible, I plan to make code publicly
      available on GitHub. This is often not possible depending on the
      nature of the project. My GitHub handle is <a
        href="https://github.com/ferrandor">ferrandor</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Mentoring students:</b> Hiring for the Summer 2026 internship
      cycle has concluded.<br>
