<p>At the University of Arizona, I assisted in teaching an entry-level undergraduate college algebra course, an upper-division undergraduate topics course in mathematics of generative AI, and a graduate core course in numerical analysis and algorithms.</p>
<p>At CUNY College of Staten Island, I was the instructor of record for entry-level undergraduate courses in college algebra, precalculus, and statistics.</p>
<p>I have used a variety of online learning tools and learning management systems, including: Brightspace/D2L, Blackboard, WebAssign, WebWork, Gradescope, and Piazza. My teaching responsibilities at various times have also included assistance with computer programming in Python, Julia, and R.</p>
<p>I recently contributed to a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mchertkov/living-books/math-gen-ai">living book</a> on the Mathematics of Generative AI, authored by Prof. Michael (Misha) Chertkov. </p>
