# About Me

I am a postdoctoral associate in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1) and the Advanced Network Science Initiative (ANSI) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, supervised by Dr. Manuel Garcia and Dr. David Fobes. I received my BS in Mathematics from Macaulay Honors College, City University of New York, College of Staten Island, and my MS and PhD from the University of Arizona's Graduate Interdisciplinary Program in Applied Mathematics, where I was advised by Dr. Michael (Misha) Chertkov. My current research focus is on optimization and control of power systems under uncertainty, ensuring that grid operations are resilient and robust to extreme events, including both natural and human disasters. I frequently employ machine learning and artificial intelligence tools in my work, and I am also interested in the mathematical and statistical physics foundations of AI.
